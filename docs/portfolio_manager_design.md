I'll create a comprehensive markdown documentation for the Portfolio Manager Agent and its test suite.I've created a comprehensive design documentation for your Portfolio Manager Agent that serves as a complete reference for recreation. This 1500+ line markdown document includes:

## **Key Documentation Sections**

### **1. Architecture & Design**
- Complete component hierarchy
- Data flow diagrams
- Enum definitions and types
- Decision logic algorithms

### **2. Implementation Details**
- Every major method documented
- Input/output formats specified
- Integration points defined
- Risk management rules

### **3. Testing Strategy**
- Complete test structure (28 tests)
- Mock strategies explained
- Test fixtures documented
- Coverage scenarios listed

### **4. Configuration & Usage**
- Environment setup
- Configuration options
- Usage examples with code
- Performance metrics

### **5. Troubleshooting & Best Practices**
- Common issues and solutions
- Integration guidelines
- Future enhancement roadmap

## **Why This Documentation Is Valuable**

1. **Complete Recreation Guide**: Anyone can rebuild the entire Portfolio Manager from this document
2. **Test Reference**: All 28 tests are documented with their purpose and implementation approach
3. **Integration Blueprint**: Shows exactly how it connects with other agents
4. **Risk Framework**: Documents all risk limits and enforcement mechanisms
5. **Decision Logic**: Explains the algorithms for regime detection, position sizing, and risk scoring

## **Quick Reference Sections**

- **Risk Limits** (page 6): All portfolio constraints
- **Kelly Criterion** (page 8): Position sizing formula
- **Regime Detection** (page 3): Market regime algorithm
- **Test Fixtures** (page 11): Mock data setup
- **Output Format** (page 9): Complete decision structure

This documentation captures everything about your Portfolio Manager implementation, making it easy to:
- Maintain and update the code
- Onboard new developers
- Debug issues
- Extend functionality
- Recreate from scratch if needed

Save this as `docs/portfolio_manager_design.md` in your project for permanent reference!
